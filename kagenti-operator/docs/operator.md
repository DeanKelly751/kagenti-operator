# Kagenti Operator

This document presents a proposal for a Kubernetes Operator to automate the lifecycle management of AI agents within a Kubernetes cluster. The operator follows a **Deployment-first model**: users create standard Kubernetes Deployments or StatefulSets for their agents, and the operator discovers them via `AgentCard` Custom Resources with `targetRef`. The `AgentBuild` CR handles building container images from source.

The `AgentCard` CR provides dynamic agent discovery by fetching and caching agent metadata (e.g., A2A agent cards) from running workloads. Each AgentCard references a backing workload via `spec.targetRef`.

The `AgentBuild` CR defines the specifications for building and publishing a container image for an AI agent. Upon creation or update of an `AgentBuild` resource, the operator will trigger a Tekton pipeline to automate pulling source code, building a Docker image, and pushing it to a specified image registry. Secure access to private repositories is managed through a reference to a Kubernetes Secret containing a GitHub token.

## Goals

* Follow a Deployment-first model where users create standard Kubernetes Deployments/StatefulSets for their agents
* Provide dynamic agent discovery through `AgentCard` CRs with `targetRef`-based workload binding
* Provide cryptographic signature verification for agent cards (JWS with RSA/ECDSA via x5c certificate chains)
* Support SPIFFE-based workload identity binding with trust-domain validation
* Enforce network isolation via Kubernetes NetworkPolicies based on verification status
* Automate the container image building and publishing process for AI agents triggered by `AgentBuild` CRs
* Integrate with Tekton Pipelines for the image building workflow, consisting of pull, build, and push tasks
* Securely manage GitHub repository access using a referenced Kubernetes Secret
* Support cluster-wide as well as namespaced scope deployment

## Deployment Modes

The kagenti operator supports both cluster-wide and namespaced deployment modes. In cluster-wide mode, it uses ClusterRoleBinding to watch and reconcile resources across all namespaces. For stricter isolation, it can run in namespaced scope using the `NAMESPACES2WATCH` environment variable, allowing the operator to only manage resources in explicitly authorized namespaces while maintaining least-privilege access controls.

## Controllers

The operator runs the following controllers:

### AgentCard Controller
Reconciles `AgentCard` CRs by resolving the backing workload via `spec.targetRef` (duck typing), fetching the agent card from the workload's `/.well-known/agent.json` endpoint, verifying JWS signatures, evaluating SPIFFE identity binding, and updating the AgentCard status.

### AgentCard Sync Controller
Watches Deployments and StatefulSets labeled with `kagenti.io/type=agent` and one or more `protocol.kagenti.io/<name>` labels (e.g., `protocol.kagenti.io/a2a`). Automatically creates AgentCard resources with `targetRef` pointing to the discovered workloads. Sets owner references for garbage collection.

### AgentBuild Controller
Reconciles `AgentBuild` CRs by creating and managing Tekton Pipelines and PipelineRuns. Tracks build status and updates AgentBuild status with the built image reference.

### NetworkPolicy Controller
Watches AgentCard resources when `--enforce-network-policies` is enabled. Creates permissive NetworkPolicies for agents with verified signatures and restrictive NetworkPolicies for unverified agents. When identity binding is configured, both signature and binding must pass for permissive access.

## Security Features

### Signature Verification
The operator verifies JWS signatures embedded in agent cards per A2A spec section 8.4 using the **X5CProvider**. The `x5c` certificate chain in the JWS protected header is validated against the SPIRE X.509 trust bundle, and the leaf certificate's public key is used for signature verification.

### Identity Binding
AgentCards are bound to workload identities via trust-domain validation. The SPIFFE ID is extracted from the leaf certificate's SAN URI (cryptographically proven by the x5c chain) and validated against the configured trust domain.

### Network Isolation
When `--enforce-network-policies` is enabled, the NetworkPolicy controller creates:
- **Permissive policies** for verified agents (allows traffic to/from other verified agents)
- **Restrictive policies** for unverified agents (blocks all traffic except DNS and operator)
